# WEBSITE_EXAMPLE
This code creates a web application using the Streamlit library to introduce and showcase the features of "Webpapt," a password management service. The app is divided into two columns:

Left Column:

Presents detailed information about Webpapt's functionality and advantages, including centralized password management, three-level encryption for enhanced security, space-efficient storage, and an intuitive user interface.
Emphasizes data privacy as a fundamental user right.
Lists the names of the creators of Webpapt.
Right Column:

Displays engaging Lottie animations that complement the content in the left column.
The app's layout is set to "wide" to make optimal use of screen space. Lottie animations are fetched from URLs using a custom function load_lottieurl. The Streamlit app provides a user-friendly interface for users to learn about the Webpapt service interactively.

If you require further elaboration on any specific part of the code, feel free to ask.
